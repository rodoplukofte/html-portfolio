<h1>THE BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO ARDA</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1) Tron:Legacy</h3>
<p>I like it, because it was exciting to watch.<br />
   It told a story that not much can like but has a deeper meaning.<br />
   Felt like a classical family movie but in a sci-fi way.<br />
</p>
<h3>2) Avengers: End Game</h3>
<p>It was just amazing.<br /> Not much to talk about it.<br /> I dont know anyone that can say that this movie is bad.<br />
</p>
<h3>3) Pasific Rim</h3>
<p>Overall great CGI usage.<br /> The plot was good and solid.<br /> Although the sequal was a disaster i still have hopes for the franchise.<br />
